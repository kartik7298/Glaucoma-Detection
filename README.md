# Glaucoma Detection using MATLAB

## Abstract
A method for detecting GLAUCOMA in a subject based on early stage screening method uses
a computer to carry out automatic analysis for eyeground photographs, thereby calculating an
eye cup-eye disk C/D ratio value in real time. The features are that the C/D value is compared
with a set GLAUCOMA risk value so as to determine the GLAUCOMA existence possibility.
The advantages are that the cup/disk ratio changes formed by GLAUCOMA pathology optic
nerve progressive damages are employed. Thus, carrying out automatic eyeground photograph
reading analysis under computer assistance.

On the other hand, Image Processing Algorithms and computer operation are introduced so as
to greatly improve determination result accuracy when compared with a conventional
diagnosis method using an eyeground photograph reading mode. This avoids expensive and
complex detection equipment with a low cost and highly efficient method. This can be carried
out by building a database, comparison of subjectâ€™s eye images and display of result under a
three-level networking system.
